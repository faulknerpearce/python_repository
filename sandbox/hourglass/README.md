# Hourglass Sum Calculator

This script computes the sums of all hourglass patterns in a 2D array and finds the maximum hourglass sum. An hourglass pattern consists of three consecutive elements in the top row, one element in the middle row, and three consecutive elements in the bottom row, forming the shape of an hourglass.

## Features

- Calculates the sums of all hourglass patterns in a given 2D array
- Identifies the maximum sum among all computed hourglass sums
- Simple, easy-to-use functions for hourglass sum calculation

## Functions

`get_hourglass_sums(array)`
- Computes the sums of all hourglass patterns in the provided 2D array.

`max_hourglass(array)`
- Finds the maximum hourglass sum in the given list of hourglass sums.

## Usage

1. Define your 2D array of numbers (as strings) in the script.
2. Run the script:
   ```
   python hourglass.py
   ```
3. The script will print the maximum hourglass sum found in the array.
